# BIke-Demand-Predications

This project focuses on predicting bike demand using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, the project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate the demand for bikes in different scenarios. This can be invaluable for bike-sharing services in optimizing their inventory and providing better service to users.

Key Features:

Time Series Analysis: The project utilizes time series analysis to understand the patterns and trends in bike demand over different time intervals. This enables the development of a predictive model that can account for seasonality and other temporal factors.

Feature Engineering: Various features such as weather conditions, holidays, and time of day are considered in predicting bike demand. Feature engineering techniques are employed to extract relevant information from the dataset.

Machine Learning Models: The project implements machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict bike demand based on the chosen features.
